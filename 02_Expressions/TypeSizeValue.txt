The result produced by a relational operator
is zero or one. In C, there is no boolean type (true or false). The zero value is interpreted
as false and any value other than zero is considered true.

Thus, if the result of a comparison is false, the value 0 is produced, otherwise, the value 0 is produced.
value 1.
